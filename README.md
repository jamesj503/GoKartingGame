# Go-Karting Game: Made with Unity
<br>
I did not make this game, I just edited it.<br>
According to the license the game had, I am able to give the game to others as long as I am not paid.<br>
I also need to remind you, this is a webGL game, by downloading all of the files, you are not able to play the game. <br>
You must go to the releases to play.<br>

Yes, this is a template game. If you want to edit it, it is on Unity [here.](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/karting-microgame-150956 "here.")
